1.1.0 | 2021-01-06

* Interesting tuples functionality was largely redone. It is now limited
  to 2D and requires inputting 1D IG. However, the results are now
  interpretable.

* Ability to output minimum IG per tuple instead of only maximum.
  NB outputted IG is still maximized over discretizations.

* Minor optimizations.

1.0.5 | 2019-11-10

* fix CUDA failure (issue in linking)

1.0.4 | 2019-10-27

* add function to discretize interesting variables for inspection

* "return.tuples" parameter now also controls returning of relevant
  discretization numbers

* change optional parameter "pseudo.count" name to "pc.xi" to better reflect
  its effect

* fix "interesting.vars" parameter to not require being sorted

* add "require.all.vars" parameter

* optimize IG computation on CPU (up to 4x speedup)

1.0.3 | 2018-11-07

* add note about recommended FDR control method

* fix a possible memory error introduced in 1.0.2 (mismatched new/delete[] operators)

1.0.2 | 2018-10-31

* improve default range estimation

* allow overriding pseudo.count in MDFS function

* set default p.adjust.method to default p.adjust method ("holm")

* set default level to suggested FWER level (0.05)

* fix CUDA version to not abruptly exit R on error

* fix use.CUDA=T in MDFS function

1.0.1 | 2018-06-26

* fix factors as input decision in ComputeMaxInfoGains,
  ComputeInterestingTuples and MDFS

* fix adjusted.p.value in MDFS

* return statistic and p.value in MDFS
